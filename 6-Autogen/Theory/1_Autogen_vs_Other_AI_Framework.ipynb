    "## 3. AutoGen vs. LangChain <a id='autogen-langchain'></a>\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "- **Architecture**: AutoGen uses an **event-driven, async architecture**, while LangChain relies on a **chain-based, sequential execution model**.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Capabilities**: AutoGen excels in **autonomous multi-agent collaboration**, whereas LangChain focuses on **single-agent workflows with structured steps**.\n",
    "- **Observability**: AutoGen provides **superior event tracking** for agent reasoning, while LangChain offers **basic tracing**.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: AutoGen’s async foundation supports **complex agent networks**, while LangChain’s synchronous design struggles with **large-scale systems**.\n",
    "- **Use Case Suitability**: AutoGen is ideal for **collaborative AI** (e.g., research teams), while LangChain is better for **data processing** or **question-answering**.\n",
